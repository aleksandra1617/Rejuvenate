    Load the xml file into a tree-like structure.

    Parameters
    ----------
    (string) path: path to the file containing the data.
    (string) options: Currently not used. Would have to pass options to the xml file as well because it is in the same
                       dictionary as the csv load. Can use this options variable later to customise how to parse the file.
    Returns
    -------
    (Element Object) root: The root node of the XML Tree.
